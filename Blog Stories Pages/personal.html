            Call me childish, but I'm still an avid minecraft player. I still find time to play and enjoy my favorite game. Does it mess with my focus and waste my time? Yes, but it's often worth it considering I improve everytime I play.
        </p>
        <h2>Ever since...</h2>
        <p>
            I have always dreamed of having my own copy of Minecraft. As a kid, I often heard so much stories from classmates taking about how fun playing minecraft was. <q>Tignan mo tong gawa ko na bahay oh (Look at the house I made).</q> a classmate once said. Of course, jelousy sparked in me and I knew that I really wanted to get a copy. And so I asked my parents to get me the game. I didn't have a PC or laptop then, and only had a tablet. So I had to ask them for the then-called <q>Minecraft: <i>Pocket</i> Edition</q> so that I can play on my tablet. They did get me the game, but its through <i>connections</i>, so to speak. My mom was part of the tech sales industry and had someone download on my tablet a version of the game that works on the current Android OS version that my tablet had, which was an older version that had just a limited world size generation. I was really thankful, yes. But I yearned for that infinite terrain that newer versions provided. And because it is just downloaded externally, I couldn't really update the game to a newer and better version.
        </p>
        <h2>Being Desparate</h2>
        <p>
            I eventually tried out alternatives. There was a game similar to Minecraft called <b>SurvivalCraft</b>, which was this moody and shader-packed alternative to Minecraft. It did have a 20-minute playing limit and had about a maximum of 10 worlds (i think) that I can make. It was, of course, because of a paywall. It did seem better because it had features that Minecraft didn't have, such as a better Electrical system and overall just a better experience. But again, since I had no money to even buy an official and non-restricted copy, I was forced to just endure the sorrow of not having any way to play my favorite sandbox game. I also had other means, like using <u>ShareIt</u>, back when it was still usable and not filled with ads, to borrow a copy of Minecraft from my cousins and even friends from school. It did work, and much better than all previous options, but it came at a cost, that being I can't sign in and join servers. It wasn't much of a bummer, and I had a lot of fun with the ever-expansive world it had, but I eventually lost interest. I let go of the game and the desire completely because there wasn't much left to do.
        </p>
        <h2>A huge leap in my dream</h2>
        <p>
            When the pandemic struck, I was bored beyond words. There was absolutely nothing worth doing because I just had no motivation to even do my own school works. Halfway through the lockdown, I had the opportunity to buy an official copy of the game, albeit it was through <i>questionable</i> methods (Like secretly stashing up coins and spare money until I could afford the game). I know it was wrong, considering the money came from my parents and it was often change for everytime I was asked to buy something, often telling them there was no money left. Once I had my own <b>official</b> copy, I became instantly addicted again. What used to be just pirated copies of the game now became this fun and convenient official copy that updates regularly. Plus, I get to join servers (yay!) which is an entirely different experience from just survival and creative mode that usually comes from the game.
        </p>
        <h2>Well, finally</h2>
        <p>
            When I gained access to servers and having the means to make my own Xbox and Minecraft account (it&apos;s actually one and the same), I became hooked onto playing minigames and socializing. I remember the first minigame I ever played was actually in this server called <u>The Hive</u>, which is <b>Survival Games</b> (plays on the concept of Hunger Games). In the next few <s>months</s> years, I became really into playing various minigames and trying out various servers to get an entirely new experience each time. I did have times when I didn't play, or stopped completely, mostly due to school and schedule reasons.
        </p>
        <h2>I just once dreamed of it</h2>
        <p>
            Even now, in the middle of my college journey, I still do play minecraft. I do so every now and then, and I'm still fond of it. I'm quite proud, albeit with a bit of regret, that I achieved what my younger self just dreamed of and barely got to do so. Minecraft is a huge part of who I am, representing a part of me that just wanted to experience the magic and the fun of building and taking on adventures. I can't just let go of that part of me, so call me childish, but I'm still an avid minecraft player.
