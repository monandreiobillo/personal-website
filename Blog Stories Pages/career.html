            To be honest, I don't know if I'll even make it to my future. It's so unclear and hard to forsee. As much as I want to look forward to what life has to offer, I can't. Is it being pessimistic? Or am I just too limited by life to even think outside the box where I stay?
        </p>
        <h2>Where is that promise of endless opportunities?</h2>
        <p>
            I thought to myself that the more I grow and progress through life, the more I'll find opportunities waiting for me. And I did encounter so many of the so-called <q>Opportunities</q> that are <q>waiting for <i>me</i></q>, as they say. But I do doubt that they were actually waiting for me. Instead of being able to grab these <i>opportunities</i>, I instead found myself held back by life itself, in the form of either other people or circumstances that prevent me from actually taking the chance. Take the audition I did for <b>Star Hunt</b> back before the pandemic. I was so excited, and I took the time to work on my audition. At that time, I also took voice lessons. In fact, I was taking voice lessons a <i>year</i> before I even found out about Star Hunt. But of course, at that exact week of auditions, I couldn't sing properly. <i>Why?</i> I started to undergo <u>puberty</u>. My voice not only cracked but also became so unreliable that I couldn't even talk properly. It wasn't <i>my</i> fault now, was it?
        </p>
        <p>
            I found a bit of hope with my profession, or at least the path towards it. I thought the tech industry is that easy way to earn and not have to work as hard as other professions, and the way they all raved about the opportunities that came with the demand for tech-related workers. But now, look at the opportunities on the job market. Unemployment rates are rising as the tech industry is slowly being filled to the brim with so many people with the same mindset. AI is also taking over the industry as more processes are faster than ever with the help of AI. It truly isn't my fault, is it?
        </p>
        <h2>As always...</h2>
        <p>
            I have other instances of opportunities that are out of my reach, and I don't think it's fault at all. I tried my best to forge my path but all I get is disappointment. I don't know what will happen to me at all. And so, for the remainder of this blog, I want to explore what I think my future <i>should</i> be or <i>could</i> be.
        </p>
        <h2>If I had the chance</h2>
        <p>
            Upon graduating, I aim to invest in my own place and have a vehicle to use, either a car or motorcycle. I also plan to find a great job, of course after a minimum of 2 years experience in a job that pays decently, regardless of how much I enjoy the job. I plan to also be able to travel and do all sorts of things, making sure I have the money and capability to do so. I truly don't know what I plan on doing next. Maybe when I get there.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if I don't get there? Life has often disappointed me by providing opportunities and chances I can't even reach. I really am forging my way towards the goals I set, but even so I don't know if I could make it in the end. I don't know if I'll even make it to my future.
