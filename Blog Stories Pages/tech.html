        <p> I <i>HATE</i> my laptop. It’s so fragile and barely does the job for me and my work. Yet, despite my dislike of my device, I still couldn’t replace it.</p>
        <h2>In the past...</h2>
        <p>I’ve had this laptop since senior high school. Back then, during the height of the pandemic, it served its purpose by being my main device for online classes and school activities. These tasks were manageable for an <i>Intel Core i3</i> laptop with <i>8GB of RAM</i> and no dedicated graphics card. I got through senior high school without any serious performance issues.
        </p>
        <h2>The problem?</h2>
        <p> What I did experience, however, were build quality problems. Just months after I got my laptop, an accident happened and the LCD broke. It took about a month to get it fixed, and during that time, I had to use alternative devices for online classes.
            The second—and third—build issue happened just months before writing this, when the hinges broke unexpectedly. At first, only one hinge broke, and to save money, I used DIY methods to fix it. Then the other hinge broke as well. Same thing—I fixed it myself. </p>
        <h2>What's worse is that...</h2>
        <p>When I reached college, I started to realize just how bad the laptop’s performance actually was. In my first year, I didn’t need much—just practice programming projects here and there. That changed when I took on the responsibility of being a marketing manager in a college organization. Suddenly, loading Photoshop took literal <i>minutes</i>. Since I hadn’t used Photoshop before this role, the slow performance made deadlines feel even more stressful. Things got worse when Figma projects for a subject required me to open around 30 Chrome tabs at once. The laptop kept buffering and became incredibly frustrating to use. It couldn’t keep up with my needs at all.
        </p>
        <h2>If I had a choice?</h2>
        <p>I couldn’t buy a new laptop because of financial reasons, but if I could, I would prioritize <b>good build quality</b> and <b>solid specs</b>. At the very least, I’d go for an <u>Intel Core i7</u>, around <u>16GB of RAM</u>, and a dedicated graphics card. I’d also choose a laptop with a metal casing and make sure the hinges would last. If I had more options, a durable, high-quality screen and a good keyboard would be a huge plus. I would rather invest in a great gadget than save money and deal with endless frustration in the future. This experience taught me that quality is better than quantity, and that spending more upfront while considering your needs is much better than settling for something cheaper but unreliable.
